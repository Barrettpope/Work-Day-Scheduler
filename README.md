The header of the application utilizes moment.js to display the current date,and each timeslot in the calendar has input capabilities where users can assign tasks for each hour of the work day. 

Additionally, the timeslots are color-coded based on the time of day the user is accessing the application. Specifically: 

    1. grey signifies past timeslot(s)
    2. purple signifies current timeslot
    3. Pink signifies future timeslot(s)

Finally, users have the ability to save their tasks to the page by clicking the save button at the end of each timeslot.
